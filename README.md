# LinuxBashScripts
Here are Linux Bash Scripts that I've created for my own use. Feel free to copy, use and modify as you see fit.

1. Change_Sound_Output.sh - This script was created to address an issue in Ubuntu where the sound will not change to the active output device.
2. start_leviathan_server.sh - This script start my VirtualBox development VM (Ubuntu Server 18.04) called "Leviathan" and Jupyter Notebook hosted on that VM then forwards the port to the host machine so Jupyter Notebook is accessible.
3. stop_leviathan_server.sh - This script stops the "Leviathan" server (VM).
